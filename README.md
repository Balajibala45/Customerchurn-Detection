# Customer Churn Detection

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning models. By analyzing customer behavior and service usage patterns, we can identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive retention measures.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their usage and subscription data.

## 📂 Dataset

- Sourced from a Telco dataset (publicly available or simulated)
- Includes features like contract type, monthly charges, tenure, payment method, and service usage
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (ML models: AdaBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Encoding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (AdaBoost, RF)
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## ✅ Results

- Best model: **AdaBoost Classifier**
- Accuracy: ~83%
- Visualized feature importance and confusion matrix
